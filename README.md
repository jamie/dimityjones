_Dimity Jones In Puzzle Castle: An Electronic Escape Novel in Eighty-Nine Ciphertexts_ is a (mostly) fictional story, contained in a single text file, that requires the reader to solve puzzles as they go along, and to use each chapter's solution as a key to decipher the next. 

Think: escape room in the form of a novel.

A computer, and rudimentary coding skills in a language of your choice, will be indispensible for performing the transformations -- and might help with the solving too!

Any and all feedback is welcome, from positive to negative, from the sweeping to the picayune. Let me know what confuses or frustrates you -- and especially let me know if (where) you get stuck.

Otherwise, there are no special instructions; it's all in the book.

While _Dimity Jones_ is still in its debugging/proofreading phase, please refrain from sharing it more widely or putting it any (other) public place.
